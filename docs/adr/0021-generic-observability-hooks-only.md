# ADR-0021 — Generic observability hooks only; no host vocabulary

**Status:** Accepted — shipped in v4.6.0.

**Date:** 2026-09-27
**Related:** ADR-0002 (the coordinator is the host extension point), ADR-0003
(the public surface is what the manifest says), ADR-0012 (substitution; its
first explicit no is reversed here), ADR-0014 (normalization and the colour
scale are not view preferences, so no sync group carries them), ADR-0016
(sync state as a peer reads it), `CONTEXT.md` (*Coordinator*, *Public
surface*, *Manifest*, *Substitution*, *Track pair*), `js/publicApi.js`,
`test/testPublicApi.js`

## Context

A host wants to drive a browser from outside the page and to mirror one panel
onto another: follow its colour scale, its normalization and the substitution
of it, its display mode, and the appearance of its tracks, and apply the same
to a peer. juicebox-web is one such host; a control layer that works on any
page embedding the library is another, and it lives in its own package, with
no DOM and no shell assumptions.

A prototype of that layer got what it needed by reaching in. It monkey-patched
the coordinator's `onColorScale`, `onDisplayMode` and the browser's
`setColorScaleThreshold`, `setNormalization`, `setDisplayMode` and
`repaintMatrix`; it put `Object.defineProperty` setters on a track's colour and
data range; it called eleven browser members the manifest did not name, so
"no callers in this repo" was a half finding for every one of them (ADR-0003);
and it carried its own locus parser for spellings `parseGotoInput` refused.
Each patch was a contract nobody had agreed to, and 4.x's enforced manifest
(`test/testPublicApi.js`) is exactly what makes that kind of reaching fragile.

The alternative was a fork of the library that knew about the host. It is
rejected: the viewer is a component (ADR-0003's correctness condition), and a
component that knows one host's transport, its grouping of participants or its
protocol is no longer embeddable by the next host.

## Decision

**1. The library gains generic hooks, and only those.** Everything the host
needed is added as an observation or a declaration any host could use:

- Four coordinator callbacks, under the existing `on*Change` convention and
  the existing `addCallback` door (ADR-0002): `onColorScaleChange
  {colorScale, browser}`, `onNormalizationChange {normalization, browser}`,
  `onNormalizationSubstituted {requested, effective, reason, browser}`,
  `onDisplayModeChange {mode, browser}`. Each fires from the same coordinator
  method the widget is told through, so a host and a widget cannot disagree.
  `setColorScaleThreshold`, which announced nothing, now notifies the
  coordinator the way the auto-threshold path always did.
- One global event, `TrackXYPairChange {trackPair, property, value}`, posted
  by every setter on `TrackPair` — colour, data range, name, autoscale and
  log scale — which the gear menu, colour picker and data-range dialog all go
  through. These were the last mutations of what a browser shows that reached
  neither the coordinator nor a bus.
- Eleven browser members named in `BROWSER_SURFACE`: `controlDataset`,
  `trackPairs`, `tracks2D`, `zoomAndCenter`, `setColorScaleThreshold`,
  `setNormalization`, `setDisplayMode`, `getDisplayMode`, `getColorScale`,
  `getSyncState`, `syncState`. All existed; declaring them makes the finding
  whole and gives the eight methods the post-dispose guard of ADR-0005.
- The same for a 2D track. Three new browser members, `removeTrack2D`,
  `setTrack2DColor` and `setTrack2DName`, which the annotation panel's delete
  and colour swatches now go through, and three global events:
  `Track2DLoad` and `Track2DRemoval`, carrying the `Track2D` as the
  track-pair ones carry the pair, and `Track2DChange {track2D, property,
  value}`. A separate event rather than a widened `TrackXYPairChange`, whose
  `trackPair` key a subscriber reads as a track pair. Before them a host could
  only splice `tracks2D` and repaint through undeclared members, and heard
  nothing.
- `parseGotoInput` accepts the looser spellings a person types: a space for
  the colon, `kb`/`mb` suffixes, the word `chromosome` before a name, and a
  `{chr, start, end}` object. Locus *parsing* belongs in the viewer.

**2. Additive, and named by what happened in the viewer.** A new payload
field is added beside the old ones (`type` on `onForegroundColorChange`), never
in place of them. A hook is named for the change it reports — a colour scale,
a normalization, a track pair's property — not for who is listening or why.
The two coordinator methods that predate the convention (`onColorScale`,
`onDisplayMode`) keep their names, per ADR-0002.

**3. No host vocabulary.** The library does not name the host, its transport,
its way of grouping participants, its protocol or its product — not in an
identifier, a comment, a test name or a doc. A host's needs arrive here
translated into the library's own language (`CONTEXT.md`) or they do not
arrive. The one document that may mention the host is this ADR's *Context*,
and it names only juicebox-web, a consumer ADR-0003 already measures.

**4. Everything goes through the manifest.** Each addition is declared in
`js/publicApi.js` — `COORDINATOR_CALLBACKS` and `COORDINATOR_PAYLOAD_SHAPES`,
`EVENTS_POSTED` and `EVENT_PAYLOAD_SHAPES`, `BROWSER_SURFACE` — and has a test
that drives it and asserts the payload against the manifest. An addition that
is not in the manifest is not public, whatever a host has found it can reach.

**5. What stays out.** Extracting a locus from a sentence, parsing a command
that names a map and a locus together, a colour-scale manager, and any
coordination of notifications across pages. Those are the host's, or the
control layer's; the viewer parses loci and reports changes.

## Consequences

**A host mirrors a panel without patching anything.** Every observation the
prototype took by force is now a subscription or an event, and every member
it reached is named. The prototype's patches are deleted on its side; a
future one that finds itself patching has found a missing hook, and files for
it here rather than working around it.

**ADR-0012's first explicit no is reversed**, dated in place: a host has
asked, `onNormalizationSubstituted` is published, and its name and payload are
contract.

**The library's language is the only language.** A reviewer can reject a
change on vocabulary alone: an identifier or comment that names a host's
transport or its session model is wrong here even if the code is right, and
belongs in the package that owns that vocabulary.

**Ships as v4.6.0**, a minor release: additive surface, no change to any
existing payload field or member, and juicebox-web builds and passes its
tests against it unchanged.
