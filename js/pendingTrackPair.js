/**
 * The placeholder row of a pending track (`CONTEXT.md`, *Pending track*): a 1D
 * track a load has named but not yet finished loading.
 *
 * It holds the track's slot in `browser.trackPairs` from the moment the load
 * starts, so the row sits in the track's position and the layout is sized once,
 * not once per arriving track. It is built from the same renderers a track pair
 * is -- the same x and y rows, reorder handle and label -- around a stand-in
 * track carrying only the name, plus the track spinner. `LayoutController`
 * swaps it for the track pair when the track loads, and removes it when the
 * load fails. #664, ADR-0017 decision 3.
 *
 * It carries a remove control where a track pair has its gear. There is no
 * timeout on a track load, so dismissing the row is how the user gets out of a
 * hung one; the load it was reserved for is discarded when it settles. #665,
 * ADR-0017 decisions 4 and 8.
 *
 * It is part of the session: `HICBrowser.toJSON` writes it from `config`, so a
 * save made while it loads keeps it. #666, ADR-0017 decision 5.
 *
 * Everything that walks `trackPairs` sees it. It draws nothing, and
 * `isPendingTrack` is what the walkers that read the track itself skip it by --
 * not `pending`, which `TrackPair` already uses for a queued repaint.
