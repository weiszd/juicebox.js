/**
 * Contract tests for the declared public surface.
 *
 * These assert what a *host application* can observe: that a name a host writes
 * is reachable on the object the host was handed. They deliberately say nothing
 * about how a member is implemented, whether it delegates, or where it is
 * declared -- a test that broke when a member moved from the prototype to the
 * constructor would be testing implementation, and would be wrong.
 *
 * The check runs one way: every declared name must exist. A new undeclared
 * member does not fail the build. See issue #470.
