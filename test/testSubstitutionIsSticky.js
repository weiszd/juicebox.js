/**
 * A substitution is sticky: state is rewritten to name what is drawn.
 * ADR-0012 decision 3, #600.
 *
 * `browser.substituteNormalization` is where that rule lives, and it has two
 * mid-render callers -- `imageTileSource`, via the observer wired in
 * `createWidgets`, and hic-straw's `alert` hook, via `dataLoader`. Both used to
 * write the triple out themselves and only one of them wrote the state half, so
 * the widget read `NONE` while canonical state still read `KR` and the next
 * render pass re-asked for a vector the file had already refused. That is #600,
 * restated by decision 4.
 *
 * Driven against a real browser rather than a stub, because the claim is about
 * canonical state and about the announcement reaching the coordinator -- a stub
 * that implemented either would be asserting its own behaviour. The loaders'
 * own seam, "both loads install the hook and report the right request", is in
 * `testStrawSubstitution.js`.
 *
 * The write is direct rather than through `setNormalization`, and that is not
 * an oversight to be tidied later: both callers are inside a render pass, and
 * `setNormalization` repaints. It is the exception documented at
 * `docs/state-manipulation.md`. The last test here is what would notice if
 * someone routed it through the chokepoint.
