/**
 * Normalization is validated against the loaded dataset, at restore. #561,
 * candidate 6, ADR-0009 decision 5.
 *
 * It is the same invariant as the clamp, at the same moment, and for the same
 * reason: restore is the first point at which the question can be asked. The
 * set of valid normalizations does not exist until a dataset is loaded, which
 * is why candidate 9 could not resolve `config.normalization` in the normalize
 * stage and left it as one of exactly three fields that stage provably cannot
 * settle. So the check has a natural home here and nowhere earlier.
 *
 * Three claims, none of which the golden (`testRestoreGolden.js`) can make on
 * its own -- it will show the coerced values moving, but a snapshot diff cannot
 * say what the rule was:
 *
 * 1. A normalization the dataset **does** offer survives restore untouched.
 *    Without this the coercion could be "always NONE" and the golden would look
 *    the same, because `test/utils/restoreDataset.js` offers only NONE.
 * 2. A normalization the dataset does **not** offer is coerced to one it does,
 *    and the load still succeeds. Coerced, never rejected -- the same rule as
 *    the clamp (ADR-0009 decision 2) and as the normalize stage one seam over
 *    (ADR-0006, #466).
 * 3. `NONE` is settled without asking the dataset. Every `.hic` file offers it,
 *    and `getNormalizationOptions` reads the normalization vector index off the
 *    file -- so asking would put a network read on every restore to buy an
 *    answer that is already known.
 * 4. The fallback is read out of the offered set rather than assumed. With a
 *    control map loaded the set is an intersection of two files' lists, and an
 *    intersection is an expression rather than a guarantee.
 * 5. A top-level `config.normalization` is resolved by the **same** enforcer.
 *    `hicBrowser.init` used to answer the same question in its own words, with
 *    its own `Set` and its own fallback, and it ran *after* restore -- so of the
 *    two enforcers the duplicate was the one that won. Candidate 6's premise is
 *    that an invariant has one enforcer or none.
 *
 * 6. **The user is told.** #372's notification half, added by ADR-0012 once the
 *    design question the validation half deferred had an answer. A coercion
 *    that nobody sees is the original report with the symptom moved: the map
 *    still comes up on `NONE` and still says nothing. The surface itself --
 *    marker, title, and the three things that clear it -- is driven at the
 *    widget's own seam in `testNormalizationSubstitution.js`; what is claimed
 *    here is that a real restore reaches it, and that a restore with nothing to
 *    report stays quiet.
 *
 * The dataset is `test/utils/restoreDataset.js`, the fixture the gate and
 * `testRestoreClamp.js` both drive, wrapped here to answer
 * `getNormalizationOptions` -- the one thing this suite asks of its dataset that
 * the shared harness (`test/utils/restoreFixture.js`) does not provide. A
 * wrapper rather than a change to the fixture: the fixture's silence on
 * normalization is itself a case this file drives (a dataset that cannot answer
 * at all), and the browser's own fallback for that silence -- `['NONE']` -- is
 * what the last test pins.
 *
 * The viewport is stated, not measured, for the reason ADR-0009 fact 5 gives.
 * Nothing here depends on its size; it is stated so the load behaves the way it
 * does in the neighbouring suites.
